# Kickstarting with Excel

## Overview of Project

### Purpose
Louise is a playwright who is passionate about creating theatrical productions that engage her viewers through various themes highlighting the human condition. The depth of her projects knows no bounds, and due to the nature of the industry, she wants to bring her creative work to life via crowdfunding. Louise is trying to start a fundraising campaign to fund her play, Fever, with an estimated budget of $10,000-$12,000. She has given us the task to analyze over 4000 campaigns extracted from Kickstarter to uncover trends, mainly to uncover the attributes of successful campaigns and what sets them apart from the rest. What is the makeup of a successful campaign, and how can we emulate those campaigns that succeeded expectations? We specifically want to filter out the Kickstarter projects that pertain to theatrical plays so we may dissect them for further analysis. Louise would like us to determine which factors are significant to improve her campaign's chances of being successful.
